# Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [PIP-1](https://github.com/hrook1/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/PIPs/PIP%20-1%20.md) process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed on the [Polygon Forum](https://forum.polygon.technology/) first.
If your proposal is discussing a new contract standard make sure you sumbitted under the [Polygon Request for Comment(PRC) folder](https://github.com/hrook1/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/tree/main/PRC)

For more information on the processes and the PIP format visit the [How to PIP.md](https://github.com/hrook1/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/How%20to%20PIP.md)

This repository tracks ongoing improvements to Polygon PoS chain. It contains:

- The [process document](https://forum.polygon.technology/) that governs how protocol changes are published.
- The PIPs that are successfully submited. 
- The [PRC folder](https://github.com/hrook1/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/tree/main/PRC), which similarly to "Ethereum Request for Comment" (ERC), the Polygon Request for Comment (PRC) is dedicated to PIP proposals that discuss token standards. 
- The Project Management of the PIPs process and the Builders Meetings (read bellow). 

If you would like to become an PIP Editor, please check [here](https://github.com/hrook1/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals/blob/main/How%20to%20become%20a%20PIP%20Editor.md) and [fill up this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6GYClhafq5sPsRDhvJeCf66dCq_iwKzwdv8uVIfu_4Y1YLw/viewform).

## Mission

In a decentralized and self-governed system, a framework is necessary for the developer community to inform, propose, and gather technical feedback on new features.

By introducing a transparent and versioned repository, the community maintains a historical record of all feature proposals, including their revision history and implementation progress.

## Preferred Citation Format

Consider any document not published at the PIP repositor as a working paper. Additionally, consider published PIPs with a status of "draft", "review", or "last call" to be incomplete drafts, and note that their specification is likely to be subject to change.

# Project Manangement 

## Purpose 

The Polygon Builders is a meeting where the Polygon community is encourged to discuss technical issues and coordinate their work around the Polygon PoS chain. The meetings are attended by core developers, validators, ecosystem partners and dapps developers.  
The calls are transcribed and recorded and will be available right after the meetings conclude. 

## Agenda

The Agenda for the meetings is hosted under the Project Management folder. Please send a pull request to the open Agenda which mentions the topic you want to discuss and links any relevant materials (PIPs, prototypes, etc.). 

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows the following guidelines: 

- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves the Polygon protocol at a low-level. This means that specific Dapps are generally not allowed as topics.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The core developer meetings are not meant to decide philosophical contentious issues that should be decided by the community. There are exceptions to this, but generally these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.

## Who Can Attend 

Core Protocol developers, researchers, POS validators, Dapp developers and Ecosystem Partners are invited to attend the meetings.
