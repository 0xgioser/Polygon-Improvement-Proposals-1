## How to become a PIP Editor 

Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) are how Polygon upgrades itself. PIP Editors have extra permissions on the PIP repository in exchange for extra responsibilities within the Polygon community.

Responsibilities as an PIP Editor include:

- Making sure PIPs are well-formatted and technically complete.
- Working with authors to get new PIPs into the repo and assist them in submitting PullRequests.
- Ensure PIPs submitted are related to Polygon products and follow the PIP standards.
- Approve and merge submitted PIPs.

**The Polygon community is looking for PIP Editors.**
